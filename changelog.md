# 2.0
- Webpack 4 (improved performace)
- Babel 7 (improved performace)
- Changed default filenames (app.js, app.scss)
- Renamed properties in config 
  - webpackConfig -> webpack
  - serve -> browsersync
  - styles.poscssPlugins -> styles.plugins
  - scripts.publicPath -> publicPath
- `publicPath` should not point to scripts dir anymore but to the src root
- Added filesize reporter (only runs with `bricks build`)
- Added config validation. Will now check if files exists
